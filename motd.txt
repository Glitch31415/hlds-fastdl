Use 'rtv' to change map if desired. Say '/blocks' to open the block menu.

Because of a GoldSrc limitation, I'm unable to load all of Sevenkewp+Half Life's assets on every map. Some lesser-spawned monsters may not have precached models or sounds. (This is also why the same sound is used repetitively, like the zombie moan)

IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE THE NUMBERED MENUS PAST THE NUMBER 5, you need to bind your 6-0 keys like so: bind 6 "slot6", bind 7 "slot7", etc until bind 0 "slot10", then it should work.
