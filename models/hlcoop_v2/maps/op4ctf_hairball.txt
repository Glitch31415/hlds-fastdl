About once every 75 years, the
temperature in the peaks over
the Black Mesa facility drops
to below freezing.  A battle
rages between the military and
civilians.  Supplies run low,
and two smaller sorties are
are cut off from the main
conflict and find themselves in
a small scale intense battle
for control of the supply bunkers.
