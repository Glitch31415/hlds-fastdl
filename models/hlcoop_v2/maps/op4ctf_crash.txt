Crash Site

Weakened by the crash of their
insertion craft, the surviving
soldiers set up camp in a nearby
structure to await word from the
main assault force to attack the
civilian base. Meanwhile, across
the crash site, scientists and
security guards of the Black Mesa
facility have learned that the
soldier's goal is not rescue, but
destruction.  The civilians, then,
quickly gathered weapons and
ammunition and prepared for the
inevitable battle.  The battle
started around the debris from the
crash site, but soon each side
discovered sewers and tunnels that
provided routes to secretly flank
opponents.
