2.  To do this, Open steam and click on the "tools" tab.
3.  Double click on "Half life dedicated server".
4.  This should bring up a new window about installing the half life dedicated server.
5.  Follow the instructions to install the dedicated server onto your computer.
6.  Now follow the link below and save it to your desktop (This is for AMXmodX)

    http://www.amxmodx.org/dl.php?filename=amxmodx-installer-1.8.0.exe

7.  Now go to the link below and save it to your desktop aswell. (This is all the files u need to make blockmaker work)

    http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=62967
    NOTE: You do not have to save these files to your desktop, but it will be easier to locate if they are in the same directory.

8. There should now be 2 new icons on your desktop, on should be named "amxmodx-installer-1.8.0.exe"
9. Double click on this icon, and a window should appear. Click "Run" then keep following the steps until you are told to click "Finish"
10. The amxmodX installer should run now. Keep following the steps until you come to a window asking you to "Choose install method"
11. If you are running on a dedicated server, you should choose the "dedicated server" option.
    NOTE: Do not choose any other options, unless you know what you are doing. They are for more advanced users.

12. Click next, and the installer will ask where you want to install amxmodx. Choose the directory you want to install to from the list.
    NOTE: If your dedicated server is not on the list, go "Back" and choose "Select Mod Directory"
    NOTE: "C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam Apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike" is the default directory for where u want to install.
    NOTE: Choose the "counter strike" addon from the drop down menu, otherwise your plugis will not work.

13. When it has extracted all the files to the directory, the installer will end. Click Finish.
14. It is advised to get a Hide N Seek mod aswel. Find one here : http://forums.alliedmods.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=23074&d=1201041609
     NOTE: Download this to your desktop aswell.

15. Ok now cos a slighlty difficult part, because if you put these files in the wrong place, it will all go wrong :(
16. Right click on the blockmaker.zip, then paste it in : "C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike"
17. Right click on it again, and choose "Extract here"
18. Then copy the hide-n-seek.zip and paste it in "C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/"
19. Right click on this and click "Extract here"
    NOTE: If you do not have the option to "Extract here" you do not have winzip or winrar. Go to the bottom of this document where it will help u download and install WinRar
    onto your computer.

CONGRATULATIONS!
You have successfully installed amxmodx, hide-n-seek, and blockmaker.
However you cannot build blocks, or start a game of HnS, because you are not an admin.

1. Go back to steam tools, and double click on "half life dedicated server".
2. This should open another new window allowing you to change your options to make the server your own.
3. Change everything to the options that suit you best.
    NOTE: Make sure if u want a private game, select "LAN" Else select "Internet". This will allow any1 to join your server.

4. When u have done this, click "Start server" and the window should close itself.
5. Following this another new window should open with 6 different tabs: "Main" "Configure" "Statistics" "Players" "Bans" "Console".
6. Click on the "console" (for future reference this will be called the "master console", and the ingame console will be "User console").
7. If you know your STEAMiD, type in: "amx_addadmin <STEAMiD>".
    EXAMPLE: amx_addadmin "STEAM_0:0:0000"

8. If you do not know your STEAMiD, open CS 1.6, and conect to ANY server.
9. When connected to a server open your user console with "`" (to the left of "1" on a standard keyboard) and type "status".
10. Now find you name on the list, and highlight your STEAMiD.
11. Right click on it and select copy.
12. Go back to the master console, and type "amx_addadmin <STEAMiD>".
13. Now close the window and go into: C:/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/[STEAM ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/configs/users.ini.
14. Scroll to the bottom where the last line should say: "STEAMiD" "" "STEAMiD" "de"
15. Edit this line to say: "STEAMiD" "" "abcdefghijklmnopqrstu" "ce"
    NOTE: Include the " and, (if it hasn't allready) replace "STEAMiD" with the STEAMiD u got u copied earlier.
    NOTE: Each letter gives the corresponding admin different accessto different plugins.
    NOTE: The access flags are explained in "users.ini"

16. When u have edited the file, go back into the master console, and type: "amx_reloadadmins".
    NOTE: You can also close the window with the master console, go back into "tools" and double click "half life dedicated server".
    NOTE: It might be easier if you RIGHT CLICK on the "half life dedicated server" and click "Create desktop shortcut" as it will be quicker and easier to start up.

17. If restarting the whole server again, the options you chose earlier, should still be there so just click "start server".
18. Now open CS 1.6 again, and connect to the server.
    NOTE: If you do not know the server IP, open Internet Explorer and go to "http://www.whatsmyip.org". The IP of the server
    will be the IP shown on that website, with the "port" you chose earlier in point 14 on the end (Default is 27015).

    Alternatively you can use the name 'localhost', this represents YOUR computer on your local network.

19. Type /bm in chat and the menu should come up.
20. Build like there's no tomorow, and have fun.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:
/bm will open the blockmaker menu.
hns_on <1|0> (in console) turns the HideNSeek mod on/off
