1)  When i type "/bm" in chat, the menu dosent come up?
    Go to C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/plugins/
    See if "Blockmaker_v3.60.amxx" is in there. If it is not, download it, and put it in this folder.


2)  When i type "/bm" in chat, the menu comes up, but most of the options are greyed out?
    Go to C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/configs/users.ini
    Scroll to the bottom and type in ["STEAM_ID" "" "abcdefghijklmnopqrstu" "ce"] 
    NOTE: Do not include the [ or ] but DO include the "
    NOTE: Replace "STEAM_ID" with your personal Steam id. To find this, go to any CS 1.6 server and type "status" in your
          user console. This will give you all the SteamID's of all the players in the server. It should look something 
          like this: steam_0:0:0000


3)  When i type amx_plugins in the console, i see "unknown unknown unknown"?
    Go to C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/plugins/
    Download "blockmaker_v3.60.amxx", and put it in this folder.


4)  When i type amx_plugins in the console, There is nothing about blockmaker?
    Download "blockmaker_v3.60.amxx", and put it in C:/Program Files/Steam/Steam apps/[ACCOUNT NAME]/dedicated server/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/plugins/


5)  I need more blocks on my server, is this possible?
    If you have lots of coding knowledge about amxx, then maybe, however it would be easier if you posted your ideas on the forum. If necro sees 
    your idea and likes it, he might add it to the next version.
    NOTE: Please dont presure people into coding for you, ASK them nicely and theres a much higher chance they'll do it for you.
