------Additional Information----------------------------------------
First thing you may say is "Isn't this a recent release?" well sure it is but its first version was so new that all the reviewers haven't even gotten to it yet.
Second since this contest wanted the "best" maps available i felt it prudent to revamp this fine map taking into account the few defects noticed in what reviews were out and submitting a second version for the world to see.
Third in all the preceeding reviews of version one scary_1 is sited as an influence on this map, well yes he was but only in the capacity of the best "competition" out there at the time this map was created, since then several others have arrisen but at the time steve was the best, so once agian i thank him as a peer.
Fourth this map contains "26" i say agian "twenty six" multiplayer starts but still i have had reports of spawn frags.. i don't know how many playerstarts halflife supports , but i don't know anyway to avoid this.

------Play Information-----------------------------------------------

Deathmatch	      : Yup
Single Player	: Nope..but contains 1 playerstart
Map History	      : About 3 years ago i discovered "Half-Life", shortly after that i discovered "Worldcraft", i could say the rest is history  but its not..cause shortly after that i met two living legends.. Jeff Meyer "Jammer" and Steve Lyne "Scary 1".. Jeff took me under their wings and my lessons began.. shortly after that Jeff had to quit mapping due to personal reasons BUT he in his infinite wisdom sent me his last masterpiece "New 41"...which i am happy to say "I" have finally become skilled enuff to complete in his stead..
How Many Players  : 10 to 15....has "26" Multi-player starts
More map info     : This map is quite large, i suggest you play it offline, learn the layout and then play online.. Each area is distinct so you should have little or no problem distinguishing where you are..
