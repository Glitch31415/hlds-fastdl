Xendance

The battle for Black Mesa has
taken a turn for the worse as
the unstable dimentional rifts
become more and more dramatic.
Now entire groups locked in
battle are finding themselves
suddenly and unexpectedly
teleported across space to the
border world known as "Xen".
But even in the strange new
surroundings, the battle
rages on.
